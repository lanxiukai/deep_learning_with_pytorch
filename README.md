## Deep Learning with PyTorch

#### Repository Intro: 
A python code repository based on the following books, intended for introductory learning in generative AI model with PyTorch framework. 

#### Reference list (books):
- Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Deep Learning. (https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
- Jakub M. Tomczak. Deep Generative Modeling. (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-64087-2)
- Aston Zhang et al. Dive into Deep Learning with PyTorch. (https://d2l.ai/index.html)

#### Experimental environment:
  - Ubuntu 24.04, x86_64
  - CUDA 13.0
  - PyTorch 2.9.1+cu130
  - Python 3.12

#### Files Intro:
- **d2l/torch.py**: Download from [https://github.com/d2l-ai]
- **d2l_save.py**: My module code fine-tuned on top of the original d2l module
- **pytorch_test.py**: Used to test whether the PyTorch module can be correctly imported and run.
- **download_dataset_genai**: Try to download and save all datasets required for this project.

#### Note:
- The code in this repository is recommended to be run in the terminal rather than in Jupyter Notebook.
- The numbers in the filenames indicate only the sequence and are unrelated to the original book’s chapter titles.
