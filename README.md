## Deep Learning with PyTorch

#### Repository Intro: 
A python code repository based on the Chinese edition of “Dive into Deep Learning” (PyTorch version) ([https://zh.d2l.ai/index.html], the English edition is here: [https://d2l.ai/index.html]), intended for introductory learning in deep learning and the PyTorch framework. 

#### Start Date:
October 2025

#### Currently Completed Update:
Chapter 6 of the original book

#### Operating System/Architecture:
Linux/amd64

#### Files Intro:
- **d2l/torch.py**: Download from [https://github.com/d2l-ai]
- **d2l_save.py**: My module code fine-tuned on top of the original d2l module
- **pytorch_test.py**: Used to test whether the PyTorch module can be correctly imported and run.
- **download_dataset_test.py**: Used to test whether the dataset was fetched successfully.

#### Note:
- The code in this repository is recommended to be run in the terminal rather than in Jupyter Notebook.
- The numbers in the filenames indicate only the sequence and are unrelated to the original book’s chapter titles.
